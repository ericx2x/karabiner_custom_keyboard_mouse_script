These json files are mouse scripts to be used as complex modifications with the program Karabiner Elements. The last edited JSON file is likely the most up to date one that I currently use where the other may be more basic backups I wanted as I developed.


# Usage
Holding spacebar and using WASD is the directions to move the mouse. 
Holding down 'L' will speed up the mouse movement where holding down 'N' will slow it down. 
'F' will left click. 
'I' will right click.
